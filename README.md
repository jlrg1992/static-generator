# static-py-generator
The static site generator that I built to work for me.
I've looked over some of them, but I think they are simply to much for what I need, so I built this little thing. It is not intended to work for everybody.

It is a static site generator using markdown files to generate simple posts. Don't think. It is not made to be a very clean code, but to work.
The code is kind of self explanatory, so there's not much you need to know.

Happy coding!

## Before starting

You'll need to install *pandoc* for it to work.

## About de markdown files

The mardown files need some metadata for it to work. It has the following structure:
'''
	title: Some title
	subtitle: A little thing here...
	date: Whichever format you want
'''
